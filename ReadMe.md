# Not My SmartThings!
These are intended for personal use only.  Providing myself a more convenient way to track very minor customization in a format that integrates easily into my SmartThings github integration.  I do not recommend redistributing and would instead recommend forking directly from the original Licensor. 

Unfortunately SmartThings github integration does not realistically allow proper fork relationships.  No ill intent to original authors.
